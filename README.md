## How to use it

1) Prerequisite: Install `brew`
2) Prerequisite: Run `brew install youtube-dl`
3) `git clone` this repo inside a cloud service folder that you use both on your computer and on your mobile. Run it every day with `source download-todays-episode.sh`. This works fine both on `sh` and on `zsh`
